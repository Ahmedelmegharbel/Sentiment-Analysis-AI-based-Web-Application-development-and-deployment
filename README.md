This repo is to develop a Python web app using Flask and integrate Embeddable Watson AI libraries to make the web app showcase AI-based abilities.

AI-based Web Application development and deployment.

----------------------------------------------------

-- In this project, we make use of the embedded Watson AI libraries, to create an application that would perform sentiment analysis on a provided text. We then deploy the said application over the web using Flask framework.

- Created an AI based sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP embedded libraries.

- Formatted the output received from the Watson NLP library function to extract relevant information from it.

- Packaged the application and made it importable to any python code for usage.

- Ran unit tests on the application and checked the validity of its outputs for different inputs.

- Deployed the application using Flask framework.

- Incorporated error handling capability in the application, such that a response code of 500 receives an appropriate response from the application.

- Ran static code analysis on the code files to confirm their adherence to the PEP8 guidelines.
